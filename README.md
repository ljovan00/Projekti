# Project Repository

This repository contains several projects that I have been working on. Each project focuses on different topics and utilizes various techniques and tools for analysis. Here are the highlights of each project:

## Analiza_podataka_burza

Analiza_podataka_burza is a collaborative project that explores stock market data and its correlation with tweets from influential individuals such as Elon Musk. 
The goal is to analyze the rise and fall of stocks based on these tweets and identify any patterns or periodicities in the data. 
The project also investigates whether specific periods of the year have an impact on the value of shares.

## Jovanović_analiza_mreža_football_transfers

Jovanović_analiza_mreža_football_transfers is a project that combines my passion for football with my knowledge of network analysis. 
The objective of this project is to analyze football transfer networks from 2000 to 2018 and uncover any hidden patterns in the data. 
The project employs various centrality metrics to examine the relationships between leagues, the dynamics of the leagues themselves, and the transfer activities among them.

## STROJNO_projekt

STROJNO_projekt focuses on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). 
It involves training a model on two distinct datasets: 
one consisting of images of fires in nature and the other containing images of nature without fires. 
The project demonstrates how CNNs can be employed for image recognition tasks. 
Additionally, it showcases the concept of "transfer learning," where pre-trained models are utilized to recognize images based on prior experience.

## Projekt_prva_godina
Projekt_prva_godina aims to compare the performance of One Stage and Two Stage algorithms. The project focuses on evaluating different architectural approaches and their impact on performance. Two different datasets with varying image qualities were used for the experiment. Several metrics were obtained, including frames per second (fps), average number of objects detected in each image, and average time per image.

Feel free to explore each project for more details, including source code and datasets.
